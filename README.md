# AODPriceConfigurator
HTML/CSS/JS files for a trial an online AOD Price Configurator

Spent several days looking at and testing various price configurators and could not find one that was capable of dealing with the Greentree pricing and AOD Hosting pricing, yet wouldn't cost a fortune.

As a little trial I created a little table in HTML/CSS (initially to use as a wireframe to have someone quote on creating a configurator).  I added a little JavaScript, and became obsessed over a weekend.  By Sunday night had the Hosting section of a configurator 90% working.

Now testing GitHub and using this project as a guinea pig!
